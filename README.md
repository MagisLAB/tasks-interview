# Task Management Application

## Overview

This is a simple task management application built with Django for the backend and React for the frontend. The application allows users to manage a list of tasks with titles, descriptions, and completion statuses.

## Features

- Django backend with REST API for managing tasks
- React frontend to fetch and display tasks
- Unit tests for Django models
- Integration tests for React components

## Setup Instructions

### Backend (Django)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MagisLAB/tasks-interview.git
   cd tasks-interview
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash

   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a superuser** (optional, for accessing Django admin):
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Frontend (React)

## Interview Steps

### Theory-Based Questions

1. Explain the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and how Django fits into this architecture.
2. What are Djangoâ€™s key features and why is it popular for web development?
3. What is the difference between unit testing and integration testing?
4. Explain the role of middleware in a Django application.
5. Describe the lifecycle of a React component.

### Coding Exercise (30 Minutes)

#### Part 1: Django Backend

1. Create a Django model for the task.
2. Create a serializer for the task.
3. Create a view to handle the API requests.
4. Add the API endpoint to the URL configuration.
5. Write a unit test for the Task model.

#### Part 2: React Frontend

1. Create a React component to fetch and display the tasks.
2. Write a test for the React component using Jest and React Testing Library.

## Testing

### Backend (Django)

To run the Django unit tests:
```bash
python manage.py test
```

### Frontend (React)

To run the React tests:
```bash
